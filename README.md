# 2D-Image Processing

This is a collection of my notes on the subject 2D-Image Processing offered at Technical University of Kaiserslautern under the department of Augmented Vision by Prof. Dr. Didier Stricker. You can learn more about the department and the department head with this link (https://ags.cs.uni-kl.de/). 

# Contents of the Repository

The repository is divided into various folders in which individual topic has been illustrated in detail. The lecture begins with a very formal introduction and ends at topics including Bayes Theorem and Particle filters. 
The sequence to be followed when going through the repository is: 

1. Introduction
2. Filters
3. Edges, Corner, Scale-Invariance and Blob detection
4. Feature matching, Tracking and Optical-flow
5. Object-Detection and SVM (Support Vector machines)
6. Face-detection and Recognition

The last 2 units i.e. Introduction to Bayesian Tracking and extended Kalman filters and Particle Filters are unfortunately not present in this repository. 

The notes are written in simple language and gives you a brief understanding of the topic. Additionally, I would higly recommend watching various YouTube videos and reading Medium articles to have a better understanding of the topic.    

# Note: 
To continue learning more about the subject, i would highly recommend attending Prof. Dr. Didier Stricker's Lecture. His methods of teaching surpasses his expertise in the subject. Further, the tutorials of the subject gives an excellant hands-on experience to better understand what is going on.
